Greetings!

This folder is used to collect data for if a consume (food+drink) is good/bad/ok for a class in WotLk.
As you've read in the README.MD file this whole project is to support Shariva and his CLA+RPB spreadsheet.

Since I am no master of a class but rather just an enjoyer of certains ones I need your help. 
If you think you know enough about your class then feel free to make a PR and issue a change. 

This spreadsheet just contains a list of ItemIds, enUs localized name of the item, 3 columns for if it's good or not and other (which stat is increased by consuming)
What I need is a CSV file that has an X in the appropriate column to indicate if this food is either good, bad or ok for that class in WotLk.

For example lets take the food Blackened Dragonfin (id 42999). This item gives you a buff for 40 Agi. 
If you know this item is good for you class then make an X in the good column.
The item Firecracker Salmon (id 34767) offers 46 Spelldamage. If you know this item is bad for your class then check the "bad" column.

If you have any questions feel free to ask either on Github or hit with a DM on Discord: Radinator#7041

Thank you for your aid!

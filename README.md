CLA+RPB related data for WotLk

Shariava (creator of CLA and RPB spreadsheets) does need our help to get the data gathered for WotLk. If you have spare time you can contribute to this repo by providing the data in various forms (text files, CSV, ...). I will try to merge them into the main branch ASAP.

Current points to work on are:
- All the WotLk gear with Frost Resistance (including green items)
- All new spells that come from WotLk (spell IDs, CDs, if it's detected via buff or cast, etc)
- All the new enchants and those who are suboptimal (if they weren't already in TBC)
- All the new consumes and those who are not suboptimal (if they weren't already in TBC)
- Information if consumes are relevant with Wrath and which are not (Scrolls, JC neck, other things)

CLA+RPB related data for WotLk

Shariva (creator of CLA and RPB spreadsheets) does need our help to get the data gathered for WotLk. If you have spare time you can contribute to this repo by providing the data in various forms (text files, CSV, ...). I will try to merge them into the main branch ASAP.

Current points to work on are:
- All the new enchants and those who are suboptimal (if they weren't already in TBC)
- All the new consumes and those who are not suboptimal (if they weren't already in TBC) -> CSV for all the consumes is WiP
- Information if consumes are relevant with Wrath and which are not (Scrolls, JC neck, other things)

Already done:
- All the WotLk gear with Frost Resistance (including green items)
- All new spells that come from WotLk (spell IDs, CDs, if it's detected via buff or cast, etc) -> main branch contains new spells learned from tainer (71-80 for all old classes and 1-80 for dk)
- Still all the other new spells like talents, talent/item/enchantment procs -> can be retrieved manually by Shariva
- All the new gems in WotLk -> main branch contains all the new gem ids but the gem colors are missing (next update)
